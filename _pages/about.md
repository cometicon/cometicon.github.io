Welcome to my personal website !


I recently graduated with a Doctorate in Computer Science from Université Grenoble Alpes. I'm specialized in computer vision and computer graphics applied in medical imaging.

# PhD project
My research aims to improve the analysis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis through external static and dynamic assessments. More details in the page [PhD](/phd/).

The project has been conducted under a CIFRE agreement between [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) (team [Morpheo](https://team.inria.fr/morpheo/)) and the company [Anatoscope](https://www.anatoscope.com/), supervised by [Sergi Pujades](http://sergipujades.free.fr/) (Inria, UGA), [Edmond Boyer](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/people/Boyer/) (Inria, UGA), [Jean-Sebastien Franco](https://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/~franco/) (Inria, UGA), François Faure (Anatoscope) and Aurélien Courvoisier (TIMC, Grenoble Hospital).

# Previous works
Before my PhD project, I have also produced work in molecular phylogeny and artificial evolution with the Inria research team [Beagle](https://team.inria.fr/beagle/). Among them, there is [Treerecs](https://project.inria.fr/treerecs/), a software that corrects gene trees with regard to a given species tree. I’ve also been involved in the development of [Seaview 5.0](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview), a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple sequence alignment.
