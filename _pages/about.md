Welcome to my home page !


I'm currently PhD student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) (team [Morpheo](https://team.inria.fr/morpheo/)) and [Anatoscope](https://www.anatoscope.com/). My project is under the supervision of [Sergi Pujades](http://sergipujades.free.fr/) (Inria, UGA), [Edmond Boyer](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/people/Boyer/) (Inria, UGA), [Jean-Sebastien Franco](https://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/~franco/) (Inria, UGA), François Faure (Anatoscope) and Aurélien Courvoisier (TIMC, Grenoble Hospital).

# Current scientific work
My work involves the creation of digital twins of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The idea is to characterize the 3D deformations of the spine from a superficial analysis of the back. I also worked on the spine dynamic reconstruction from a motion capture analysis. You can find details about the published works in the section [*Contributions*](/publications/).

# Older works
I worked in molecular phylogeny and artificial evolution projects with the Inria team [Beagle](https://team.inria.fr/beagle/). Among them, there is [Treerecs](https://project.inria.fr/treerecs/), a software that corrects gene trees with regard to a given species tree. I’ve also been involved in the development of [Seaview 5.0](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview), a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple sequence alignment.
