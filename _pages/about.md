Welcome to my personal website !


I recently graduated with a Doctorate in Computer Science from Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA). I'm specialized in computer vision and computer graphics applied in medical imaging.


# PhD project
My research aimed to improve the analysis of spinal deformities through external static and dynamic assessments. For this purpose, we employed deep-learning techniques and created subject-specific kinematic models correlating the internal and external specificities of the patients.
You can find more details about my work on the page [PhD](/phd/).

# Previous works
Before my PhD project, I have also produced work in molecular phylogeny and artificial evolution with the Inria research team [Beagle](https://team.inria.fr/beagle/). Among them, there is [Treerecs](https://project.inria.fr/treerecs/), a software that corrects gene trees with regard to a given species tree. I’ve also been involved in the development of [Seaview 5.0](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview), a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple sequence alignment.
