Welcome to my personal website !

# Current scientific work
My name is Nicolas COMTE, I'm currently PhD student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) (team [Morpheo](https://team.inria.fr/morpheo/)) and [Anatoscope](https://www.anatoscope.com/). I'm under the supervision of Sergi Pujades (Inria), jean-Sebastien Franco (Inria), François Faure (Anatoscope) and Aurélien Courvoisier (Grenoble Hospital). I'm working on the characterization of the spine with scoliosis from superficial analysis of the trunc.

# Older works
I worked in molecular phylogeny and artificial evolution projects with the Inria team [Beagle](https://team.inria.fr/beagle/). Among them, there is [Treerecs](https://project.inria.fr/treerecs/), a software that corrects gene trees with regard to a given species tree. I’ve also been involved in the development of [Seaview 5.0](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview), a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple sequence alignment.
