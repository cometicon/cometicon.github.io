## Summary of the project
The aim of this research is to combine diverse techniques for digitizing the human body to develop virtual avatars of individuals with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). Also called *digital twins*, they are used to identify and examine potential medical issues.

This project is mainly focused on the analysis of AIS through external static and dynamic assessments.

In the static aspects, I employed deep learning techniques to generate 3D reconstructions of the spine from depthmaps of the back.

For dynamics, I investigated the feasibility of reconstructing dynamic spinal trajectories (translations and rotations) by integrating subject-specific kinematic models in motion capture analysis.

## Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)

My work is mainly focused on Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). AIS is a complex medical condition characterized by 3D deformities of the spine that evolves during the adolescence.

If left untreated, scoliosis can progress and result in breathing difficulties, chronic pain, and other health issues.

The main treatment is to stop scoliosis progression with an orthopaedic brace. Therefore, this requires early detection of the disease for effective treatment.

An other challenge is to reduce the patient's X-ray exposure during both the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, since frequent exposure increases the risk of cancer development.
