## Summary of the project
In our research, we employ various techniques to digitize the human body creating digital twins of individuals with spinal deformities. Our project focuses on patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS), characterized by deformities that evolve during adolescence.

The objective is to improve the analysis of AIS through external static and dynamic assessments. The project has been conducted under a CIFRE agreement between [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) (team [Morpheo](https://team.inria.fr/morpheo/)) and the company [Anatoscope](https://www.anatoscope.com/), supervised by [Sergi Pujades](http://sergipujades.free.fr/) (Inria, UGA), [Edmond Boyer](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/people/Boyer/) (Inria, UGA), [Jean-Sebastien Franco](https://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/~franco/) (Inria, UGA), François Faure (Anatoscope) and Aurélien Courvoisier (TIMC, Grenoble Hospital).

In the static aspects, we employed deep-learning techniques to generate 3D reconstructions of the spine from depth maps of the back. This work aimed to allow for a more detailed overview of the spinal alignments from external measurements as recommended for detection and monitoring of AIS. See our pre-print in HAL: [hal-04362152](https://hal.science/hal-04362152).

For dynamics, we investigated the feasibility of reconstructing dynamic spinal trajectories by integrating subject-specific kinematic models in motion capture analysis. Our objective is to create a model allowing for a comprehensive 4D analysis of the patient's trunk with AIS. See our article: [here](https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10070874)

## Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)

My work is mainly focused on Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). AIS is a complex medical condition characterized by 3D deformities of the spine that evolve during the adolescence.

If left untreated, scoliosis can progress and result in aesthetic alterations, breathing difficulties, chronic pain, and other health issues.

The main treatment is to stop scoliosis progression with an orthopaedic brace. Therefore, this requires early detection of the disease for effective treatment.

An other challenge is to reduce the patient's X-ray exposure during both the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, since frequent exposure increases the risk of cancer development.
