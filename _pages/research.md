The aim of my research is to combine diverse techniques for digitizing the human body to develop virtual patient avatars. These digital twins are used to identify and examine potential medical issues.


I'm currently focused on the analysis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) through static and dynamic assessments. We employ deep learning techniques for generating a 3D reconstruction of the spine from depthmaps. Additionally, I have investigated the feasibility of creating dynamic spinal trajectories by integrating biomechanics and motion capture.
